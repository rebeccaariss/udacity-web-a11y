# Accessibility Overview

## Introduction to Accessibility
- Understanding accessibility helps to create interfaces which are more delightful and easy to use for _everyone_
- It's about so much more than compliance and regulations
- There are plenty of misconceptions. A lot of developers feel that addressing accessibility will force them to choose between creating a delightful & attractive experience and ticking a box saying that their site is accessible.

### What do we mean by accessibility?
Broadly speaking: the goal is for a site's content to be available to everyone and for functionality to be operated by anyone; everyone should be able to access it.

As developers, it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming that all users can see and use a pointer interface (like a mouse or a touch screen) and experience your application the same way that you do. The experience you create might work for a narrow range of people, but can create issues for anyone outside of that range.

_Accessibility,_ then, prefers the experience of users who might be outside of that narrow range and who might access or experience things differently to the way the person we picture as a "typical user" would.

We will be exploring what happens when we take an inaccessible site and make it more accessible.
