## What is "A11y"?
_A11y_ stands for _accessibility_. It is a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym), with 11 representing the count of letters between the letter "a" and the letter "y".
â€“ From [The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/about/), a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.

P.S. The A11y Project is open-source project. You can view and contribute to their GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com).
